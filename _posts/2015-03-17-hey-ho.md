Well, I'm back.

Last month was really something hard to describe. I got some high-and-lows, from the endless pain to
deal with real state firm to accomplish a long-time dream.

The beach is like some minutes by walking, all the major concerns are going to be solved in the next
few months (I hope).

I was never sure why I wanted to live near the ocean, but it is just a matter of words and
explanations. In the first time that I saw the see (after moving out), I just felt that I did the
right thing.

So, there's a *lot* going on, but soon I plan to get back to real business and start to work on my own
projects, besides the company I work to.

This is just a "hey I'm alive" post, nothing much to add. But I like to thank everyone that helped
me, even just by saying _"everything will be allright"_, you can't imagine how good it is to have
people like this around me.

So thank you very - *VERY* - much!

Meanwhile...
